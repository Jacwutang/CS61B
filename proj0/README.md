Project 0 - Simulation of planetary motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Issac Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.

To run:

javac NBody.java
java NBody 15778800.0 25000.0 data/planets.txt


157788000.0 = Time (secs)
25000.0 = change of Time (secs)
data/planets.txt = file containing information about planets. velocity, initial x,y position, mass, picture id.
